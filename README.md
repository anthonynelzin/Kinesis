# Kinesis Advantage2 macOS layout

A Kinesis Advantage2 optimized for the use of macOS. The main changes from the default layout consist of:

- easier one-handed shortcuts with the left thumb:
  - the `Delete` key becomes the `⌘` key
  - all the arrows key are under the left hand fingers
  - the `End` key becomes the `⌥` key
  - the `Home` key becomes the `⌃` key
- easier access to `⌘⇥` and `^⇥` with the left hand:
  - the left `Control` key becomes the `⇥` key
  - the `Alt` key becomes the `⇧` key
- easier one-handed shortcuts with the right hand:
  - the `Windows` key the `Hyper` key
  - the right `Control` key becomes the `⌘` key

As the print screen, scroll lock and pause keys are useless on macOS, they have been remapped to play/pause, volume down and volume up respectively.
