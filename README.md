# Kinesis Advantage2 macOS layout

A Kinesis Advantage2 optimized for the use of macOS. The main changes from the default layout consist of:

- the `Delete` key becomes the `⌘` key
- the `End` key becomes the `⌥` key
- the `Home` key becomes the `⌃` key
- the left `Control` key becomes the `⇥` key
- the `Alt` key becomes the `⇧` key
- the `Windows` key the `Hyper` key
- the right `Control` key becomes the `⌘` key

As the `⇪` key has been remapped to the `\`` key, the `\`` key serves as a shortcut to the character viewer. As the print screen, scroll lock and pause keys are useless on macOS, they have been remapped to play/pause, volume down and volume up respectively.
